Yesterday findings on globals() and locals() function brought me to how objects are treated in a function or other words passing objects to functions.

<p> Inner working of each programming language is special to itself but there are concepts that are being used to make in almost every programming language, one key task in any language is to pass arguments to functions and there are multiple ways to do that. What seems to be common is that primitive types are passed by value and reference types are passed by reference. There are lots of differences under the hood (like passing by assignment)in languages that I searched for (JavaScript and Python) but I find Python amazingly clear on data types (mutable, Immutable, subscriptable, etc). The next thing that I really like to do is learning about underlying data structures for each data type in popular languages üîç. Learning about computer engineering is always like going down a rabbit hole but the rewarding experience of learning always worth it.             </p>
