“Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.” Robert C. Martin <br>

Today I wanted to use Beautiful Soup Python library. It would have been a good idea for my blog generator and I had to look at how it works in order to learn it. Nested classes (I don’t know if that is what it is called) were so hard to wrap my head around and somehow I started trying to learn to read other’s codes then I stumbled on this beautiful quote. I don’t know the ratio of reading and writing but definitely I should read more code. That was something worthy of learning today.
