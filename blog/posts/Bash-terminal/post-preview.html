As much as I love working with computer terminal it is quite challenging to learn everything about them.Of course I wouldn't learn everything, but

there are cool things we can use it for and it is also different from programming in a way and it is always good to do something just to get push

yourself further and think from a different perspective. I love this journey of mine.             </p>
