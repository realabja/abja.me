Recently I wanted to use inheritance for and object in JavaScript and seemingly classes in JavaScript do not support them and there is a way to use inheritance by calling prototype object there are lots of built-in objects in JavaScript and some times trying to use them is complicated I need to practice more to learn about them. every day I discover more complexity of programming and it gets more interesting.             </p>
