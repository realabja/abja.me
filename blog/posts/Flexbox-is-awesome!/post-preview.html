These days I am trying to make a new template and while writing it, I tried to learn the grid first. It is a great layout, but I could not achieve what I wanted. It would have looked good if I wanted a more complex design though. I found out and learned more about flexbox, I enjoy using it. in near future, I might build something with grid layout. It is extremely powerful, I believe bootstrap uses it, I have never used bootstrap but grid looks really interesting suddenly from nowhere!!! check the thing out if you are interested in is in my <a href="https://github.com/realabja/powercoders/tree/master/Week2/themeHunting">github</a> for now ðŸ‘‹ .             </p>
