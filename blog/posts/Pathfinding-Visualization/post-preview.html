I wanted to do this project for a long time I finally made it. I will put it online as soon as I can. There were lots of things that I needed to brush up, I can say,  it was fun. There were lots of mistakes, I learned a lot about my coding and where I make lots of mistakes and that is reassigning values, most importantly I think was the practice of finding problems,  yet my code isn't perfect and  I need to find solution to some performance issues that I found, but it works for now <br> here is the link if you wanted to see the code <a href="https://github.com/realabja/Pathfinding_Visualization">GitHub</a> and the <a href="">link</a> to play it online I will add more algorithms to make it more fun.             </p>
