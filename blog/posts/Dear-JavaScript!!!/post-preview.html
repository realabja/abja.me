While JavaScript is among the best programming languages, it is not always easy to comprehend.  For me, challenging part in JavaScript is async functionality, How I can use it in my benefit I haven't discovered yet. I have to use it for a sleep() function. I don't have a clear idea on how many things work in JavaScript, but always good to be curious. It seems to me is that the async approach has some performance gain but I don't have the full picture yet.             </p>
