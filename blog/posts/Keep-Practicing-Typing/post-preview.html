I feel I am making progress in my typing. The key to improving typing as said in <a href=”www.typing.com”> typing.com </a> is just paying more attention to accuracy and speed comes with time and practicing but I need to be more aware of accuracy in order so form sort of &rdquo; memory muscle &rdquo; . there is also a suggestion to spend some time every day practicing typing and I have scheduled to spend 20 minutes morning and evening to keep the momentum             </p>
