                                These days I am trying to make a new template and while writing it, I tried to learn the grid first. It is a great layout, but I could not achieve what I wanted. It would have looked good if I wanted a more complex design though. I found out and learned more about flexbox, I enjoy using it. in near future, I might build something with grid layout. It is extremely powerful, I believe bootstrap uses it, I have never used bootstrap but grid looks really interesting suddenly from nowhere!!! check the thing out if you are interested in is in my <a href="https://github.com/realabja/powercoders/tree/master/Week2/themeHunting">github</a> for now 👋 .             </p>

                        there are cool things we can use it for and it is also different from programming in a way and it is always good to do something just to get push

                        I wanted to do this project for a long time I finally made it. I will put it online as soon as I can. There were lots of things that I needed to brush up, I can say,  it was fun. There were lots of mistakes, I learned a lot about my coding and where I make lots of mistakes and that is reassigning values, most importantly I think was the practice of finding problems,  yet my code isn't perfect and  I need to find solution to some performance issues that I found, but it works for now <br> here is the link if you wanted to see the code <a href="https://github.com/realabja/Pathfinding_Visualization">GitHub</a> and the <a href="">link</a> to play it online I will add more algorithms to make it more fun.             </p>

                            Recently I wanted to use inheritance for and object in JavaScript and seemingly classes in JavaScript do not support them and there is a way to use inheritance by calling prototype object there are lots of built-in objects in JavaScript and some times trying to use them is complicated I need to practice more to learn about them. every day I discover more complexity of programming and it gets more interesting.             </p>

                                    While JavaScript is among the best programming languages, it is not always easy to comprehend.  For me, challenging part in JavaScript is async functionality, How I can use it in my benefit I haven't discovered yet. I have to use it for a sleep() function. I don't have a clear idea on how many things work in JavaScript, but always good to be curious. It seems to me is that the async approach has some performance gain but I don't have the full picture yet.             </p>

                            “Indeed, the ratio of time spent reading versus writing is well over 10 to 1. We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code. ...[Therefore,] making it easy to read makes it easier to write.” Robert C. Martin <br>

                            Today I wanted to use Beautiful Soup Python library. It would have been a good idea for my blog generator and I had to look at how it works in order to learn it. Nested classes (I don’t know if that is what it is called) were so hard to wrap my head around and somehow I started trying to learn to read other’s codes then I stumbled on this beautiful quote. I don’t know the ratio of reading and writing but definitely I should read more code. That was something worthy of learning today.

The key to improving typing as said in <a href=”www.typing.com”> typing.com </a> is just paying more attention to accuracy and speed comes with time and practicing but I need to be more aware of accuracy in order so form sort of &rdquo; memory muscle &rdquo; . there is also a suggestion to spend some time every day practicing typing and I have scheduled to spend 20 minutes morning and evening to keep the momentum             </p>

                                    Coursera’s course on web development has been nothing but an amazing source to learn principles that I was missing, today’s highlight for me was combining the selectors and its rules I believe it is a powerful tool with that can increase clarity in a stylesheet. I need to have this tool in my mind in the future to use it.

                                    Yesterday findings on globals() and locals() function brought me to how objects are treated in a function or other words passing objects to functions.
                                    
                                    <p> Inner working of each programming language is special to itself but there are concepts that are being used to make in almost every programming language, one key task in any language is to pass arguments to functions and there are multiple ways to do that. What seems to be common is that primitive types are passed by value and reference types are passed by reference. There are lots of differences under the hood (like passing by assignment)in languages that I searched for (JavaScript and Python) but I find Python amazingly clear on data types (mutable, Immutable, subscriptable, etc). The next thing that I really like to do is learning about underlying data structures for each data type in popular languages 🔍. Learning about computer engineering is always like going down a rabbit hole but the rewarding experience of learning always worth it.             </p>

                            I had a really tough time figuring out how Ruby works behind the Jekyll and making my own static page generator seemed a worthy adventure, here is the link to<a style="color: rgb(109, 109, 253);" href=”https://github.com/realabja/pagegenerator” target=”_blank”> GitHub repo</a> I used python and learn a lot about its functionalities like globals() function which is a way to address all variables and their names it works slightly different than normal function (I believe). I used it to be a bit more dynamic with passing values one thing that I wish I found a way to use is Closers. I have learned about them recently and meaning to use them for a while. Also, I wasted quite of time on regex and realizing match objects are different than search object. But overall it was a productive weekend and that is all I need to be happy. Peace ✌️        </div>

                                This is my first blog post. in the last few days, I have tried to learn more about jekyll and how it works. It is a great straight forward webpage generator built on Ruby working and it is integrated to GitHub pages putting files in the correct format and structure and jekyll in GitHub`s background (backend), will generate webpage of the choice. But I think there are tons of lines of code 😋 in its source code which is freely available in GitHub, that is a good place to visit. I want to know more about jekyll`s inner working and how I can use it. There is a problem regarding jekyll that I`m facing, It is not easy to control structure and HTML and CSS in the final result, There are of course some articles on how you could change the layout and structure last thing to be said, discovering new aspects of jekyll and Ruby always worth doing it.
